/**
 * Allows obtaining various connectivity aspects of a graph. The <i>inspected
 * graph</i> is specified at construction time and cannot be modified.
 * Currently, the inspector supports connected components for an undirected
 * graph and weakly connected components for a directed graph.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The inspector methods work in a lazy fashion: no computation is performed
 * unless immediately necessary. Computation are done once and results and
 * cached within this class for future need.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The inspector is also a {@link org._3pq.jgrapht.event.GraphListener}. If
 * added as a listener to the inspected graph, the inspector will amend
 * internal cached results instead of recomputing them. It is efficient when a
 * few modifications are applied to a large graph. If many modifications are
 * expected it will not be efficient due to added overhead on graph update
 * operations. If inspector is added as listener to a graph other than the one
 * it inspects, results are undefined.
